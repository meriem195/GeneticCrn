## Abstract
We address the power control problem in cognitive radio networks where secondary users exploit spatial spectrum opportunities without causing unacceptable interference to primary users. An optimization problem is formulated aiming at maximizing the utility of secondary users and to ensure the QoS for both primary and secondary users. To solve the power allocation problem a genetic algorithm is developed, and two fitness functions are proposed. The first is oriented towards minimizing the total transmit power consumption of the secondary network. The second is a multi-objective function and is oriented to the joint optimization of total capacity and transmit power consumption of the secondary network. Results show a near-optimum performance of the genetic algorithm aided power control scheme based on the multi-objective fitness function.
